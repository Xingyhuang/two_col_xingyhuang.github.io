###  Future precipitation increase from extreme atmospheric river storms

Detecting and characterizing AR events at various locations along the US West Coast can be quite challenging, due to the need to capture both large-scale water vapor transport and fine-scale landfalling features over complex terrain. My postdoctoral work involved the configuration of a climate modeling framework using optimized WRF configuration to study event-based ARs and AR changes in a warming climate, from large-scale atmospheric features to meso-scale processes. Due to the large uncertainty surrounding intensification of high-magnitude and/or statistically rare events, this is the first effort to dynamically downscale extreme events from a large ensemble (CESM-LENS, which is one of the most important simulation resources generated by NCAR) in a systematic way. My work disentangled the large-scale dynamic, thermodynamic, and local processes to future changes in extreme precipitation during ARs, emphasizing an inhomogeneous increase in extreme precipitation over the coastal and mountainous regions including historically drier regions both spatially and temporally.

**Figure 1. Smooth-topo versus native grid extreme AR precipitation.** (a) Same as Figure 3a but for the output from smooth-topo simulations. (b) Smoothed topography versus native-grid accumulated total precipitation for all of the AR events over each region. Note: (1) The scatter points include grid-box values with event-total above 20 mm from corresponding ARs; (2) ùë¶ = x line is also depicted as a visual aid; and (3) dashed lines at certain thresholds are also added for better illustration.

**Figure 2: Spatial distributions of moisture fluxes from the 60 historical (left) and future (right) AR events (WRF 81 km) under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario.** a) Composite hourly instantaneous IVT map showing the moisture flux transport pattern averaged over each of the 60 ARs for each period at the time of maximum hourly precipitation over California. b) Geographical distributions of the AR events, with each open circle denoting the locations at 12-hourly time intervals. The location is defined as the grid box with maximum IVT value; color shading denotes IVT magnitude). (***From Huang et al., 2020, Science Advances***)
