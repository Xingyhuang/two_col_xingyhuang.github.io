###  Climate variability and precipitation

Multiple forcings and drivers can contribute to the behavior of heavy precipitation events and their responses to climate change. My work first focuses on diagnosing the mean-state changes, both globally and over the Pacific, using the newly generated Multi-Model Large Ensemble. I am using these simulations to uncover consistent mechanisms operating across multiple models and affecting the behavior of changes in the mean and extremes. I am also building a deeper understanding of the role of climate modes in affecting precipitation, with a focus on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific decadal variability. The response of these modes to climate change exhibits large uncertainty within models and ensembles, and consequently I aim to develop an explanation for how physical constraints affect future projections of the ENSO variability  (Huang and Stevenson, 2020, in prep).

### A new generation of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Large Ensemble

I am also co-leading the development of a new large ensemble of climate model simulations using the DOE’s newly developed Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). This ensemble will be a powerful new community resource, with higher output frequency (6-hourly, ideal for meteorological and downscaling applications) and spatial resolution compared to most large ensembles. This work provides a new resource for understanding decadal climate variability. These efforts are part of a collaborative DOE project involving both atmospheric and oceanic experts from Georgia Tech, UCSB, NOAA, and Los Alamos National Lab.  (Stevenson et al., 2020, in prep)
