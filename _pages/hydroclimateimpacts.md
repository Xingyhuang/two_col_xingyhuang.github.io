###  Warming Impacts on Snowpack and Flood Risk with intensified precipitation extremes

There are significant implications from the response of ARs and extreme precipitation to a warming climate: for instance, the strong hydroclimate impacts. Over the Sierra Nevada, I found that future runoff increases from extreme ARs are dramatic â€“ nearly 50% more than historical maximums, reflecting both the precipitation increase and simultaneous conversion of snow to rain. This extreme runoff during ARs could raise significant challenges for water resource management and flood control, as shown in one of my previous work, implying historical warming may have exacerbated runoff conditions underlying the Oroville Dam spillway emergency during February 2017 over the north CA. _(**Huang et al. 2020**, GRL, in revision; **Huang et al. 2018**, GRL, [doi: 10.1029/2018GL077432](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL077432).)_

**Figure 1: Distribution of precipitation and surface runoff within each of the 20 SN watersheds, for all historical and future ARs events.** a) boxplot for grid-scale event-total precipitation over each watershed at each time period, ordering from north to south, starting with the windward side and then moving to the leeside (from left to right); b) As in (a), but for event-total surface runoff. c) Watershed divisions with topographical details overlaid; the black labels refer to the windward side watersheds and white ones refer to leeside watersheds. In panels a) and b), the width of the box is the interquartile range, the tails are the 5th-95th percentile range, and the line in the middle is the median of the distributions. Black boxplots illustrate historical results and red ones future values. (***From Huang et al., 2020, GRL, in revision***)

###  Human activity on land-use and associated climatology impacts over irrigation regions

Irrigation is an important contributor to the regional climate of heavily irrigated regions, and within the U.S. there are few regions that are as heavily irrigated as California's Central Valley, responsible for 25% of domestic agricultural products. One of my PhD work found that summertime temperatures are notably overestimated in both global climate model (here, CESM) or regional climate model (here, WRF) over Central Valley. By enabling a simple but flexible irrigation scheme into the CESM, we found that insufficiently parameterized human activity (here irrigation) was the main reason for that warm bias, under relatively realistic estimates of agricultural water use. Over heavily irrigated regions, models should enable an irrigation parameterization to better capture local temperature statistics and human activity impacts through land-air interactions. _(**Huang and Ullrich, 2016**, JAMES, [doi: 10.1002/2016MS000656.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016MS000656))_
