    title: "Climate variability and precipitation"
    excerpt: 'Precipitation extremes over the western US are a major focus of my work, due to their deleterious impacts on ecosystems and human society; these impacts are projected to intensify under a warming climate. Part of my research program focuses on understanding how large-scale forcing and climate variability affect the behavior of precipitation extremes, and how both are affected by uncertainty due to climate model biases. Given the large uncertainties within global climate models and the importance of internal (unforced) climate variability, I use large ensembles -- that is, sets of many simulations with identical model physics but different initial conditions, to improve statistical significance and identify consistent aspects of forced changes in 21st century climate projections.'

    title: "Atmospheric rivers (ARs)"
    excerpt: 'Characterized by narrow and filamentary corridors of enhanced water vapor flux, ARs are of outsized importance along the U.S. West Coast. However, the formation, propagation, and controlling factors for ARs’ evolution and changes are not well understood. It is crucial to combine both observations and models to improve this understanding. A significant portion of my recent research efforts has been devoted to investigating historical AR events and using climate models to simulate and diagnose the characteristics and future projections of ARs, especially those with the greatest impacts.'

    title: "Hydroclimate impacts"
    excerpt: 'There are significant implications for snowpack, water resources, streamflow, and flooding risk, etc under a warming climate and intensified climate extremes. As the drought condition predicts to be more severe and precipitation to be more extreme, the loss of snowpack and intensified flood risk informs policymakers for better climate adaptation strategies for water resources supply and flood control. My recent research efforts have also been devoted to studying regional hydroclimate impacts and to provide scientific support to public communities. I am also involved in ongoing collaborations on examining the consequences of ArkStorm scenarios in a highly populated urban environment and how precipitation extremes can affect landslides and post-wildfire debris flows.'

    title: "Climate downscaling"
    excerpt: 'Climate downscaling enables connections between regional and global scales, and across disciplines (particularly between hydrologic, atmospheric, and land-surface processes). The strength of such linkages (such as, future water resources, flooding control, land-use impacts) could provide significant ways to resolve real-world problems under changing climatic and environmental conditions. The need for high-resolution data is increasingly fast and it usually requires intensive computational practices and resources. I have been focused on improving regional scale climate studies by pushing forward state-of-the-art high-resolution modeling methods.'

## Research overview

My long-term goal is to bridge the gaps between global and regional climate and hydrological processes, and by doing so to provide improved risk assessments associated with future climate extremes and variability that can be of use to policy and stakeholder communities. I use various methods and techniques in my research, including coupled atmospheric-oceanic global modeling, high-resolution regional atmospheric modeling, machine learning methods, and observational data. I am also interested in bringing new modeling and analyzing methods into my research with interdisciplinary perspectives and collaborations from not only atmospheric and oceanic sciences, but also geography, economics, computing, and environmental sciences, etc.
